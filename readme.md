# Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system developed by Francesco Cirillo.  It utilizes a timer to break up intervals of work and break.  You work 25 minute "pomodoros" followed by a 5 minute break.  After 4 pomodoros you take a 10 minute break and then start the cycle over again.
